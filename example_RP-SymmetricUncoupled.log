No tolerance was specified, using default value instead: 1e-10

Starting with SpinSystem "system1".
Using rate constant from first transition object ("product1") in the SpinSystem "system1"!
Found rate constant value: 1e+06
---------------------------------------
Found radical 1 with 2 spins:
 - Unpaired Electron: electron1
 - Subspace dimensions: 4
 - Other spins:
   - nucleus1

Found radical 2 with 1 spins:
 - Unpaired Electron: electron2
 - Subspace dimensions: 2
 - There are no other spins.

Spins not included in radicals: 0 / 3
---------------------------------------
Spins that are not included in the radicals are not considered in the calculations.
